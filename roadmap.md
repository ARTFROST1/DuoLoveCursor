\# üìò Full Development Roadmap ‚Äî Telegram WebApp for Couple Games



This document outlines a comprehensive step-by-step plan to take your concept from design to production \*\*with backend, frontend, game engine logic, and deployment\*\*.



---



\## üéØ Phase 0: Initial Specification \& Planning



\### 0.1 Final Requirements \& Scope

\- Define feature list: user invites, pairing, games, achievements, history, settings.

\- Agree language support: RU (default) and EN.

\- Visual theme: light/dark, animations, avatar list.

\- UX flows: from welcome screen to game invitations and partner disconnection.



\### 0.2 Design Assets

\- Design UI mockups (Figma/Sketch): all screens (welcome, main, games, profile, settings, game sessions).

\- Prepare visual components: avatars, icons, emojis, success/fail screens.

\- Specify typography, colors, spacing, animation style.



\### 0.3 Architecture \& Stack Decisions

\- Frontend: Telegram WebApp entry + Single Page App (React/Vue/Svelte).

\- Backend: choose runtime (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.), use WebSockets or polling.

\- Database: start with SQLite or PostgreSQL.

\- Hosting: Vercel, Render, AWS/GCP for backend, storage, WebApp static assets.

\- Define API endpoints and real-time mechanics.



\### 0.4 Project Setup

\- Init Git repository, branch strategy (main, feature branches).

\- CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).

\- Issue tracker / Project board (GitHub Projects, Trello, Jira).

\## üîß Phase 1: Backend \& Data Layer



\### 1.1 Database Schema

\- Implement tables: users, partnerships, games, invites, game\_sessions, history, achievements, user\_achievements, settings.

\- Add migrations and seeds (initial avatars set, achievements list, default games).



\### 1.2 API Design

\- REST or GraphQL endpoints:

&nbsp; - User registration / lookup by Telegram ID.

&nbsp; - Invite creation and accept.

&nbsp; - Fetch partnership state.

&nbsp; - Fetch main data: partner profile, days together, recommended cards.

&nbsp; - Fetch games list and categories.

&nbsp; - Game session creation/invite/accept.

&nbsp; - Statistics, achievements, history.

&nbsp; - Settings: update avatar, name, theme, language.

&nbsp; - Disconnect partner.



\### 1.3 Real-Time Mechanism

\- Implement WebSocket channels or long-poll notification:

&nbsp; - Send invitation event to partner.

&nbsp; - Sync in-game progress.

&nbsp; - Notify status changes (online/offline).



\### 1.4 Business Logic

\- Enforce one active partner per user.

\- Handle invite tokens securely.

\- Progress achievements on events (e.g. new game, streak).

\- Persist game session results and update history.



\### 1.5 Testing Backend

\- Unit tests for DB models and logic.

\- Integration tests for API endpoints.

\- Manual testing with Postman or curl flows (invite ‚Üí accept ‚Üí partnership).

\## üßæ Phase 2: Telegram WebApp Frontend



\### 2.1 WebApp Boilerplate

\- Set up SPA (React/Vue/Svelte) within static hosting.

\- Integrate Telegram WebApp JS: initialization, sizing, WebApp.ready, popup \& alert behaviour.



\### 2.2 Welcome Screen

\- Render "Welcome" with "Find Partner" button.

\- On click: call API to generate invite token.

\- Show shareable link (Telegram deep link).

\- After partner joins: reload to main UI.



\### 2.3 Navigation \& Routing

\- Bottom nav menu: Home, Games, Profile.

\- Hide until partnership is active.

\- Implement route-based page components.



\### 2.4 Home Page

\- Fetch with API: user info, partner info, days together.

\- Render avatars, status (online/offline), names, days counter.

\- Fetch carousel content: promotions, news, blog.

\- Implement horizontal swipeable carousel.

\- Show ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button (primary CTA).

\- Show recommended/recent games tiles with custom labels (e.g. "Play again", "Beat your best").



\### 2.5 Games Page

\- Fetch categorized game list from API.

\- Display category headers with color-coded backdrops.

\- Render animated tiles with description labels / badges.

\- On click:

&nbsp; - Call API to create game session / invite partner.

&nbsp; - Wait for partner accept via real-time channel.

\- Show a modal or overlay with ‚Äúwaiting for partner‚Ä¶‚Äù animation.



\### 2.6 In-Game Session

\- Build basic interactive game (e.g. reaction mini-game).

\- Use real-time sync via WebSocket:

&nbsp; - Share progress events.

&nbsp; - Render both users‚Äô states.

&nbsp; - At end: send final result to backend, close session.

\- On completion: show summary screen and option to return home or play again.



\### 2.7 Profile Page

\- Fetch user and partner info.

\- Show avatar, name, partner block clickable.

\- Segmented control with tabs:

&nbsp; - \*\*Statistics\*\*: total online time, games played, favorite game, wins/losses.

&nbsp; - \*\*Achievements\*\*: render tiles with emoji, title, description, progress bar, sorting (complete first).

&nbsp; - \*\*History\*\*: recent game entries (date/time, game, partner, result\_short).

\- Settings button: top-right gear icon.



\### 2.8 Settings Screen

\- Allow:

&nbsp; - Change avatar from preset list.

&nbsp; - Edit display name.

&nbsp; - Toggle theme (light/dark).

&nbsp; - Switch language (ru/en).

&nbsp; - Enable/disable sound and notifications.

\## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Polish \& Quality Assurance



\### 3.1 UI Polish

\- Animations (carousel transitions, page transitions, input feedback).

\- Responsive layout on mobile sizes, orientation support.

\- Accessibility: alt tags, good color contrast, readable font size.



\### 3.2 End-to-End Testing

\- Simulate full user flows: invite ‚Üí accept ‚Üí play game ‚Üí disconnect.

\- Cover edge cases: partner offline, invite expired, partial disconnect.

\- Browser/device testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, desktop Telegram).



\### 3.3 Error Handling

\- Show user-friendly messages for failures (network error, invite invalid, partnership already exists).

\- Graceful recovery: retries, state resets.

\## üö¢ Phase 4: Deployment \& Release



\### 4.1 Frontend Hosting

\- Deploy SPA to hosting (Vercel, Netlify, S3+CloudFront, etc.).

\- Configure HTTPS, custom domain if needed.



\### 4.2 Backend Hosting

\- Deploy backend with API + WebSocket to server (Render, Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).

\- Ensure secure token storage and environment variables.



\### 4.3 Telegram Bot \& WebApp Integration

\- Submit bot via BotFather with WebApp URL.

\- Set deep-link start parameter for invites (refer to Telegram docs).

\- Ensure WebApp section opens and UI scales correctly.



\### 4.4 Analytics \& Monitoring

\- Integrate simple analytics (games played, DAU, invites).

\- Implement error logging (Sentry, LogRocket).

\- Monitor API uptime, latency.



\### 4.5 Launch Strategy

\- Soft launch with limited users for QA/feedback.

\- Iterate improvements before full rollout.

\- Prepare onboarding instructions.

\## üîç Notes \& Suggestions



\- Start with a \*\*minimum viable product\*\*: one simple game to validate mechanics.

\- Separate frontend and backend repos for clarity.

\- Use mock data and mock sockets early in development.

\- Document public API endpoints and event flow clearly.

\- Keep In-app i18n support from the beginning (texts, formatting).

\- Ensure privacy/security best practices (invite tokens expire, no data leaks).
